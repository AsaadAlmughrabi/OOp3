# Transportation System

Welcome to the Transportation System project! This Python module provides a simulation of a transportation system with various modes of transport, including cars, bicycles, and buses. It allows users to calculate travel time and cost for different transportation methods based on the distance to be traveled.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: The code is organized into separate classes for different transportation methods, allowing for easy extension and modification.
- **Strategy Pattern**: The project utilizes the strategy design pattern to encapsulate algorithms for calculating travel time and cost, enabling flexibility and reusability.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality and help maintain code reliability.
